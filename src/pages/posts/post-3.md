# Foundations- Data, data, everywhere

## Week 1: Introducing data analytics

- **Data** is a collection of facts, including numbers, pictures, videos, words, measurements, and observations
- **Dataset**: A collection of data that can be manipulated or analyzed as one unit
- **Data analysis** involves collecting, transforming, and organizing data to draw conclusions and make predictions.
- Data evolves over time and can provide new information through analysis.
- A **data ecosystem** is a group of elements that interact to produce, manage, store, organize, analyze, and share data.
- Data can be found in something called the cloud, rather than on a computer hard drive.
- **Data science** is defined as creating new ways of modeling and understanding the unknown using raw data.
- **Data analysis** is the collection, transformation, and organization of data to draw conclusions, make predictions, and drive informed decision making.
- **Data analytics,** in the simplest terms, is the science of data.
- The **six steps of the data analysis** process are: ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act.
- **Data-driven decision making** is defined as using facts to guide business strategy.
- Organizations in various industries are constantly empowered to make better, data-driven decisions through data analysts.
- A **data analyst** finds data, analyzes it, and uses it to uncover trends, patterns, and relationships.
- Sometimes the data-driven strategy will build on what has worked in the past. Other times, it can guide a business to branch out in a whole new direction.
- Data analysts play a critical role in ensuring that data are built into every business strategy. Data alone will never be as powerful as data combined with human experience, observation, and intuition.
- To get the most out of data-driven decision-making, it's important to include insights from people who are familiar with the business problem. These people are called **subject matter experts**. Subject-matter experts can offer insights into the business problem, identify inconsistencies in the analysis, and validate the choices being made 

- Analysts use data-driven decision-making and follow a step-by-step process. You have learned that there are six steps to this process:
	1.  **Ask** questions and define the problem.
	2.  **Prepare** data by collecting and storing the information.
	3.  **Process** data by cleaning and checking the information.
	4.  **Analyze** data to find patterns, relationships, and trends.
	5.  **Share** data with your audience.
	6.  **Act** on the data and use the analysis results.
- **Gut instinct** is an intuitive understanding of something with little or no explanation. Don’t use it in data analysis
- Different **data analysis life cycle / process:**  the process of going from data to decision:
	- Google Data Analytics Certificate is data analysis life cycle1
		1.  **Ask**: Business Challenge/Objective/Question
		2.  **Prepare**: Data generation, collection, storage, and data management
		3.  **Process**: Data cleaning/data integrity
		4.  **Analyze**: Data exploration, visualization, and analysis
		5.  **Share**: Communicating and interpreting results 
		6.  **Act**:  Putting your insights to work to solve the problem
	- EMC Corporation's data analytics life cycle is cyclical with six steps:
		1.  Discovery
		2.  Pre-processing data
		3.  Model planning
		4.  Model building
		5.  Communicate results
		6.  Operationalize
	- SAS's iterative life cycle, a leading data analytics solutions provider.
		1.  Ask
		2.  Prepare
		3.  Explore
		4.  Model
		5.  Implement
		6.  Act
		7.  Evaluate
	- Project-based data analytics life cycle:
		1.  Identifying the problem
		2.  Designing data requirements
		3.  Pre-processing data
		4.  Performing data analysis
		5.  Visualizing data
	- Big data analytics life cycle. From the book Big Data Fundamentals: Concepts, Drivers & Techniques: 
		1.  Business case evaluation
		2.  Data identification
		3.  Data acquisition and filtering
		4.  Data extraction
